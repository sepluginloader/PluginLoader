# PluginLoader
A tool to load plugins for Space Engineers automatically.

## Installation

It is recommended to wait to install Plugin Loader until after the Automatons update is released. If you must install it now, use these *temporary* install instructions to install it:
1. Download and extract the 0Harmony.dll and PluginLoader.dll files from the [Releases page](https://github.com/sepluginloader/PluginLoader/releases). 
2. Make sure the files are not blocked before continuing by opening the file properties of each of the extracted files and checking the Unblock box if it exists. 
3. The extracted files can now be placed in the game Bin64 folder. You can find the Bin64 folder by right clicking on Space Engineers and selecting Properties. Then under the Local Files tab, select Browse and navigate to the Bin64 folder. 
4. Add the Plugin Loader to the [game launch options](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947) using the following string: `-plugin PluginLoader.dll`

After the game is released, the new [game launcher](https://github.com/sepluginloader/SpaceEngineersLauncher) will be needed instead of any game launch options.
